echo "Versions of Python that you have:"
python2 -V
python3 -V
echo "	Python 3 syntax is simpler and easily understandable whereas Python 2 syntax is comparatively difficult to understand.
Python 3 supports modern techniques like AI, machine learning. 
It is also supported by a large community and has a lot of different libraries and tools. 
At the same time Python 2 is used for configuration management and old versions of programs that are written on Python 2.

So we recommend Python 3 for you  :)"
